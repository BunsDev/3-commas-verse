## My Commit for Schelling Point Virtual Hackathon

## Deployed Project 🌐

https://3-commas-verse.vercel.app/


## Project Overview 🚀

''In this repository I built a web app which displays various crypto **details** and **useful news**, for **traders** in real time.''<br>
User can search prices and news related to the crypto of **their choice**.


The app was build with **React JS**. In depth we are...

- Using **RapidAPI** to fetch data from 2 different API's ( Coinranking, Bing News Search) with **custom Hooks**.

- Managing our States with **Redux**.

- Using **Ant Design** to create our UI.

- Rendering charts using **Chart.js**.

The components are fully functional so feel free to navigate around as well as view on **mobile**. In mobile version please view chart in **landscape mode** for a better experience. 

## Note: ## Under heavy traffic this site will break because we I'm using a free RapidAPI key and that limits the amount of requests the webserver can send.


## Future Ideas 💭

There can be a lot of things to be implemented since the app is build with components and it's easy to modify them.

Some of them..

- Add **technical indicators** on the chart which would make **algorithmic trading** applicable.

- Connect our app with the **3CommasApi** for more **advanced endpoints** for trading.

- Add **dark Mode** button.
